1.6 Principle component analysis

(1) Basis of orthogonormal vectors
(2) Expression for residues after k rounds
(3) Heuristic to choose the top-k directions

In PCA there are two major components present. 1) n: no of dataset
2) no. of features 

the first component In PCA captures the most variance in the dataset 
When the number of features becomes large, the time complexity of PCA goes high.
Features in the dataset have non-linear relationships.

PCA tries to find Eigrnvectors,
How can we do that, Here is a example

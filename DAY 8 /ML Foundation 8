3.1 Four fundamental Subspaces 
3.2 Orthogonal subspaces and Vector 
3.3 Projections
3.4 Least squares and Projections onto subspaces
3.5 Example of Least Sqaure

The four fundamental subspaces are following:
Row space, Column space, Null space and Left null space.

This are helpful to describe properties and structure of a matrix.

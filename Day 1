Machine learning Foundation 

Before starting someone should have pre-requisite topics from mathematics and Statistics.
Differentiability and derivative
Critical points: Local maxima and local minima
Linear Algebra(Vectors, Determinant, Linear equations, Matrix)
Dimensions, Rank, and Null space
Derivatives and Directional derivatives.

Further, In machine learning, we should know how a function works.

Regression modal:
It has a set of input values that give output in a label form. It should learn the modal function of working so it can take the input and manipulate it according to the regression modal.
Nowadays we learn machine learning to give tools sufficient data and algorithms to convert input to output.

A simple task of identifying a password:
when someone types a password it sends it to the server then it searches for suitable files if it passes then it is competing 

Algorithm of machine learning (any modal)
Input >>> Software >>> output
          human creating regression modal is a software on that formula it works on.
